üé≤ Murder mystery È≠îÊ≥ï‰Ωø„ÅÑ„ÅÆÁú†„ÇãÂ≥∂; This repository guesses the person who keeps BLACK CODE on the game.

ARCHIVED; because it was found that the game specification was more complex than I expected; I had multiple things to want to do with Python simultaneously. In order to prevent the life from becoming busy, I archived this repository which was not so important.
